                <p>Chris Evans Eyes MCU Return In The Russo Brothers’ Avengers: Doomsday</p>

                <p>On your left — exciting MCU news coming through! Having made a memorable and wholly unexpected cameo in this summer's r-rated (and newly Golden Globes nominated) mutant mash-up Deadpool & Wolverine, it looks like Chris Evans isn't quite ready to call time on his relationship with the Marvel Cinematic Universe just yet. According to Deadline, Evans is heading for a reunion with his Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame co-star Robert Downey Jr. and directors The Russo Brothers on upcoming Multiverse Saga movie Avengers: Doomsday.</p>

                <p>Much like the movie's plot, details regarding who exactly Evans will play in Doomsday are under wraps for now — and the multiverse being what it is, there's certainly no shortage of options. Per Deadline's reporting, sources state that Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson will be Captain America in the team-up joint, meaning it's unlikely but not impossible that we'll see Evans suiting up to play America's Ass one last time. He could however still be Steve Rogers again, who we last saw as an old man at the end of Avengers: Endgame having lived a long and happy life with his wartime sweetheart Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). There's also the possibility that, having just left us in creases reprising his role as a decidedly swearier Johnny Storm than we've ever seen him play before in Deadpool & Wolverine, Evans could pop up to "Flame on!" once more for the hell of it — though knowing that the MCU's First Family from The Fantastic Four: First Steps will be in Doomsday would make that seem unlikely. You also can't rule out the possibility that Evans could rock up as an entirely different character from Marvel's illustrious canon — after RDJ's casting as Doctor Doom, all bets are well and truly off!</p>

                <p>Jeremy Allen White Joins The Mandalorian & Grogu Movie As Jabba The Hutt’s Son Rotta</p>

                <p>Jeremy Allen White may well be one of the most dynamic actors working today. He's handled the heat and stayed in the kitchen in The Bear, flexed his muscles as professional wrestler Kerry Von Erich in Sean Durkin's emotional duplex of a movie The Iron Claw, and will soon be seen getting his Boss on in Bruce Springsteen biopic Deliver Me. And for his next move? Well, according to THR, White's about to swap Nebraska for a galaxy far, far away. Yes, the in-demand New Yorker is joining the Star Wars universe and will be voicing a key role in Jon Favreau's recently wrapped Mandoverse movie The Mandalorian & Grogu.</p>

                <p>Per the trade's reporting, White is set to voice Rotta the Hutt — son of limacine gangster Jabba — in Favreau's new Star Wars spin-off, which will see Pedro Pascal reprise his role as the titular bounty hunter from The Mandalorian as he continues adventuring in space with his adoptive son Grogu. White is only the second new name to have joined the call sheet for the movie, following Sigourney Weaver's casting back in May. And while we have no idea who Weaver will be playing just yet, or indeed exactly what the plot will entail as plot threads from Ahsoka and Rebels (and possibly even Skeleton Crew) all look set to converge, we have met White's character Rotta before.</p>
